    "- Step 1: If use_hsv is true, convert the image to hsv (see skimage rgb2hsv - skimage has a ton of these conversion routines)\n",
    "- Step 2: reshape the data to be an nx3 matrix kmeans assumes each row is a data point. So you have to give it a (widthXheight) X 3 matrix, not the imagedata as-is (WXHX3). See numpy reshape.\n",
    "- Step 3: Whiten the data\n",
    "- Step 4: Call kmeans with the whitened data to get out the centers\n",
    " Note: kmeans returns a tuple with the centers in the first part and the overall fit in the second\n",
    "- Step 5: Get the ids out using vq\n",
    "    -- This also returns a tuple; the ids for each pixel are in the first part\n",
    "    -- You might find the syntax data[ids == i, 0:3] = rgb_color[i] useful - this gets all the data elements with ids with value i and sets them to the color in rgb_color\n",
    "- Step 5: Create a mask image, and set the colors by rgb_color[ id for pixel ]\n",
    "- Step 6: Create a second mask image, setting the color to be the average color of the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Two ways to do this\n",
    " -  \"undo\" the whitening step on the returned cluster (harder)\n",
    " -  Calculate the means of the clusters in the original data\n",
    "    np.mean(data[ids == c])\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Step 7: use rgb2hsv to handle the hsv option\n",
    "- Simplest way to do this: Copy the code you did before and re-do after converting to hsv first\n",
    "     Don't forget to take the color centers in the *original* image, not the hsv one\n",
    "     Don't forget to rename your variables\n",
